# TankBattle
Unreal Engine Test 2

In the summer of 2019, I had a little time on my hands, so I decided to learn about the unreal engine. [Udemy's Unreal course](https://www.udemy.com/unrealcourse) has been my introduction to the game engine and TankBattle is an open-world tank fighting simulation that is used for educational purposes in section 7.
